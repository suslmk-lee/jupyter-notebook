# IPython Notebook Buildpack

The `ipython-notebook-buildpack` is a [Cloud Foundry][] buildpack for exposing [IPython Notebook][] files.

## Usage
To use this buildpack specify the URI of the repository when pushing an IPython Notebook file (or directory of files) to Cloud Foundry.

    cf push --buildpack https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/jupyterlab-notebook-buildpack.git

As the IPython notebook uses Websockets you must access it on Cloud Foundry using port 4443, e.g. https://app-subdomain.cfapps.io:4443

## Conda Version

Create a file named `conda_runtime.txt` containing the Miniconda version you wish to use as conda-runtime. Otherwise `Miniconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` (python 2.x) will be used.

Find different runtimes here: http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/

Use `Miniconda3-3.7.3-Linux-x86_64.sh` for python 3.x support.

## Notebook Dependencies
The buildpack supports dependencies declaration using a `requirements.txt` file located in the root of the directory being pushed to Cloud Foundry.

## Notebook Config
Additional notebook configuration can be specified using a file named `additional_notebook_config.py` in the root of the app directory.

In particular you can password protect your notebook server by creating a SHA1 hash of your password and adding this to the config file as follows:

    # Password to use for web authentication
    c = get_config()
    c.NotebookApp.password =
    u'sha1:85607904acb0:bd228c0989e8df2018d0777428b1bb974ba7d2c0'

See [the IPython documentation](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/public_server.html) for further
instructions and more configuration options for the server.
